## Common Questions

**Q: Which payment rail should I use?**
A: Direct for reliability, x402 for micropayments, Tempo for international, ZK for privacy.

**Q: Are ZK payments really private?**
A: Yes, they use zero-knowledge proofs to hide transaction details while maintaining verifiability.

**Q: How fast are x402 payments?**
A: x402 offers real-time streaming payments, typically settling in 1-2 seconds.

**Q: Can I reverse payments?**
A: Most payments are irreversible on Stellar, but some rails offer dispute resolution.

**Q: What are the fees for different rails?**
A: Fees vary: Direct (~0.00001 XLM), x402 (~0.001 XLM), Tempo (~0.5%), ZK (~0.002 XLM).

## Tips

- Always compare rail costs before large payments
- Use x402 for frequent small payments
- Consider ZK for sensitive transactions
- Use Tempo for international transfers
- Save frequently used recipients
- Set up payment notifications
- Keep records for tax purposes
- Use memos for payment identification

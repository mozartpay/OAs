**Examples**:
```bash
# Basic quote
"swap 100 XLM to USDC"

# Different swap type
"strict receive 50 USDC from XLM"

# Complex assets
"quote for 200 XLM to EURC"
```

**Response Elements**:
- Exchange rate and fees
- Estimated amount received

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between strict-send and strict-receive?**
A: Strict-send guarantees the amount you send, strict-receive guarantees the amount you receive.

**Q: How accurate are the profit calculations?**
A: They're based on current market conditions, but actual profits may vary due to slippage and timing.

**Q: Can I lose money with arbitrage?**
A: Yes, market conditions can change quickly, and execution costs may exceed profits.

**Q: What's the minimum amount for profitable arbitrage?**
A: It depends on the assets and market conditions, but typically 100+ XLM is needed.

- Always check current market conditions before executing
- Use slippage protection for larger swaps
- Monitor multiple asset pairs for better opportunities
- Consider transaction costs in profit calculations
